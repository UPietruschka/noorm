                            Services, resp. DAOs generated by NoORM are singletons. By default, the services
                            or DAOs are instantiated right after class loading and provided by the class method
                            "getInstance".
                            Alternatively, class instantiation can be delegated to a dependency injection framework
                            like Spring. By specifying parameter serviceInterfacePackageName, the service generator
                            is directed to omit the in-class singleton implementation and generate appropriate
                            interfaces for every service, resp. DAO in the given package.

                            Primary key generation for new records being inserted into the database can be based
                            on a numeric ID column and an sequence. Sequences are not tied to a table
                            by definition, so associating a table with a sequence is done using this property
                            list. Note that the association TABLE_NAME/SEQUENCE_NAME can either be done on a per
                            table basis, or using one or more regular expressions to specify a mapping rule like
                            "TBL_(.*)" -> "SEQ_$1" (This rule would map TBL_PRODUCT to SEQ_PRODUCT, for example).

                            Some database tables may have a couple of fields, which are identically in name
                            and purpose (i.e.: "ID", "UPDATED_BY", "UPDATED_AT", etc.).
                            For those tables, it can be helpful to apply some functionality for these columns
                            by the means of a custom interface.
                            Using this parameter, it is possible to specify the name of the interface, which
                            is (automatically) implemented by the generated bean. Keep in mind that the
                            required method names for the specified interface (with respect to possible renaming)
                            must exist in the generated class.
                            Note that the interface name must be fully qualified, when it does not reside in
                            the same package, which has been configured with parameter "beanJavaPackage".
                            Like in all other mappings, regular expressions may be used to specify the
                            mapping.

                            While NoORM supports updatable views, not all database platforms have support for
                            updatable views. Alternatively, one may configure the NoORM generator to generate
                            beans for views as well as for the base tables.
                            Using this parameter, it is possible to specify the base table bean as super class
                            for the view bean. With this mechanism, the view bean can be used in the generated
                            bean DML service API generated for the base table.
                            Note that the super class is expected to be a Java Class name and not the associated
                            database table name. For NoORM beans generated for a single Java package, a fully
                            qualified Java class name is not required, other super class references must be
                            fully qualified.

                            Regular expression to filter tables and views for inline sequence value generation.
                            When sequences are used to generate primary key values for tables, the sequence
                            values are retrieved from the database using a separate SQL statement. This is
                            the most flexible approach concerning performance for bulk inserts and the provision
                            of the generated values for the application (i.e., the beans subject to insertion
                            are modified by setting the primary key values on the fly).
                            However, for tables typically having single inserts only (no bulk inserts) with a
                            sequence increment of 1, it can be preferable to inline the sequence generation to
                            avoid the extra database round-trip to get the next sequence value. For single
                            row inserts, NoORM can return the updated bean (primary key value), too.
                            This parameters allows for a flexible specification of the beans / tables subject to
                            inline sequence value generation using a regular expression.

                            has a column with a code or denominator in uppercase letters, which uniquely

                            Beans generated from database entities are often subject to data enrichment in
                            the service layer utilizing the bean data. One option to add additional data to
                            the bean is the generic (generated) bean property "auxiliaryData". However, some
                            data consumers may require data provided in a flat bean without nested data
                            (i.e., the additional data is available using standard bean properties).
                            As an alternative approach to the auxiliary data property, the user may create
                            a subclass for the generated bean with additional bean properties. To utilize
                            this inherited bean classes, the generated services using the originally generated
                            class should use the subclass. This parameter allows to replace occurrences of the

                            The implementation of methods "equals" and "hashCode" for the generated beans raises
                            the same questions intensively discussed for JPA entities. In particular, three options
                            are available: do not implement these methods at all, implement them based on the
                            technical ID, i.e. the primary key, or implement them based on some business-id.
                            The latter is not applicable for generated code, since we do not have the required

                            Thus, options one and two remain and this option can be used to choose one. Note that
                            this option is set to true by default (i.e. methods equals and hashCode are
                            automatically implemented based on the primary key).

                            When multiple data sources are used, the data source name as configured in the NoORM
                            configuration file is used to identify different data sources. To specify the data
                            source used for the subsequent statements, one can either set the data source explicitly
                            using DataSourceProvider.setActiveDataSource, or one can specify the data source name
                            here. Note that for explicit transaction handling, one still have to specify the data
                            source name.

                            The NoORM query declaration is intentionally much simpler than most other approaches
                            to specify alternatives to original SQL. While specifications like the JPA 2.0 criteria
                            API aim to cover most of the capabilities of SQL, this approach consequently follows
                            the paradigm to move database-centric functionality to the database.
                            In particular, this means that the complexity of an SQL statement should be implemented
                            inside the database using views. Following this approach, it is almost always possible
                            to reduce the query declaration for automatic Java code generation to a single entity
                            (table, view), the columns subject to the where-conditions (concatenated by "AND") and
                            the operators used for the columns in the where-conditions.

                            Some table columns are designed to never change their value again after insertion.
                            For instance, columns denoting the creation time or the user, who created the
                            record are candidates for columns, which never change.
                            In principle, one may pass the initially inserted value again with subsequent
                            updates, but this can be cumbersome.
                            Thus, using this configuration parameter, columns can be specified, which will be
                            omitted by the automatic generation and execution of update statements.
                            To specify a column, define a mapping from a table name to a column name.
                            Like in other mappings, regular expressions can be used to simplify the mapping.

                            The Java code generator defines for every database type a default Java type, which is
                            used in the generated classes for attributes and method parameters (e.g. NUMBER ->
                            java.lang.Long).
                            However, this mapping may not be suitable for certain situations. This configuration
                            parameter provides a flexible way to define custom type mappings.
                            Note that the database type depends on the database system and is not checked for validity,
                            but simply compared against the database types as retrieved from the database metadata.
                            So, an invalid database type has simply no effect.
                            The specified Java type however is checked for existence by the code generator, but not for
                            validity with respect to a proper data conversion in the JDBC driver used.

                        The database (source) type of the custom type mapping. This is the SQL standard or
                        vendor specific type declaration like "INTEGER" or "NUMBER". Note that only the base
                        type declaration is used to identify an attribute applicable for a custom type
                        mapping (e.g. fractions of numeric types are ignored, but through the usage of the
                        filter regex for tables and columns it is usually no problem to restrict the mapping
                        to the column(s) of choice).

                The database (source) type of a custom mapping. This is the type used in the generated
                Java code for the column annotation of the bean attributes.
                The available types resemble the types declared in java.sql.Types.
                With Java 8, type handling has become more comfortable by introducing enum JDBCTypes.
                Since this enum is not available in earlier Java versions, it has been copied for the
                current NoORM release.
